# HackerStarFox
Star Fox (SNES, 1993) source code, with modifications for easier creation of ROM hacks 

For compile options, see SG/VARS.INC.

Thanks to Kandowontu and Vitor Vilela for the SuperFX2 Upgrade.

Building is easy if you've used the Star Fox EZBuild.

## Future things to do
1. Organize source files and edit makefile accordingly
2. FastROM
